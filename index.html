<h2>About George Pastirik:</h2>

<p> George Pastirik, President of Science Is..., has made science both his career and his hobby. Starting with a "lab" in the basement of his parentâ€™s home when he was 12, he developed an interest in earth science, while also tinkering with chemistry, physics and biology. 
George has his M.Sc. in Geological Sciences from Brock University and has worked as a petroleum geologist in Calgary. He is also Past-President of the Calgary Science Network (now the Alberta Science Network), and is a frequent volunteer for the Calgary Science Hotline.
 George has done hundreds of presentations, workshops, science fairs and field trips for students, as well as teachers and parents of Calgary-area children. An experienced science fair judge, George can also advise on the design, execution and presentation of science fair projects, as well as advising on the design and organization of the science fair itself.
